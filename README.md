I've made a simple html only recipe website. created it by putting the boilerplate with the necessary attributes, then started in the body section by adding heading elements, paragraphs, as well as both links and image elements, lastly both unordered and ordered list elements. i also decided to link the images by using a relative path because it's more reliable considering the pictures are in my local project directory.

now that i've done basic html, i've went on to apply basic css box model method to the homepage. nothing fancy but it'll do for now.
